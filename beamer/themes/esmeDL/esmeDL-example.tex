\frametitle{Introduction} 
\framesubtitle{Sous titre de la frame} 

Nous avons mis au point un thème \texttt{beamer} \og ESME\fg~pour 
\LaTeX~à destination des concepteurs de ressources pédagogiques 
numériques.\newline

Ce modèle prend la forme d'un \og template\fg~contenant des 
dispositions types.\newline

Ce modèle est conforme à la charte graphique de l'ESME (couleurs, 
logos).

\emph{N.B : la police d'écriture est celle de~\LaTeX}\newline

    Vous pouvez utiliser (actuellement) 2 types de pages de titre pour
    les sections avec la commande \texttt{\textbackslash sectionframe\{n\}} 
    où $n=1,2$.\newline

    Cette page indiquera le numéro et le titre de la section dans laquelle
    vous vous trouvez.\newline

    Les trois \texttt{frame} suivantes montrent 3 exemples.
